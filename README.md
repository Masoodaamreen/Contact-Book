# Contact-Book

This is a simple, console-based Contact Book application built with Python. It allows users to manage a personal list of contacts, each stored as a name-number pair.

**Features:**
Add New Contacts: Easily add new names and their corresponding 10-digit phone numbers. The system includes validation to prevent duplicate names/numbers and ensures numbers are numeric and 10 digits long.

**Search Contacts:** Find contacts by either their name or phone number.

**Delete Contacts:**  Remove existing contacts from the book by specifying their name or number.

**Display All Contacts:** View a complete list of all saved contacts.

This application is designed for straightforward contact management directly from your terminal, providing a practical example of Python's dictionary usage, function organization, and user interaction.
